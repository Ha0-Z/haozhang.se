        <h2>Welcome to My Website!</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Hao Zhang, a passionate developer and student at KTH with a strong interest in technology and programming. Since high school, I have been programming in various languages, including Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and have developed a wide range of projects â€“ from games like Snake, Tetris, and Tic-Tac-Toe to responsive and user-friendly web applications using frameworks like Angular.

            I have a solid understanding of both frontend and backend development and experience using tools like Git for version control. My technical expertise also extends to designing and optimizing network systems. For example, I designed and implemented a stable mesh network for my family.
            
            Beyond my technical skills, I have a strong passion for teaching. I enjoy helping my classmates when they encounter programming challenges and often use my whiteboard at home to illustrate and explain concepts. Additionally, I am multilingual and communicate fluently in Swedish, English, and Chinese.
            
            My goal is to continue growing as a developer and contribute to innovative and efficient solutions. Whether working on system development, network design, or educational material, I always strive to deliver the highest quality and value.
            
            Feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more or collaborate on an exciting project!</p>
